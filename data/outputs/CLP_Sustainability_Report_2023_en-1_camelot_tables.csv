through experiential activities.
May 2023 saw the opening of CLP Pulse, a new museum 
featuring themed exhibitions on the history of the 
electricity industry in Hong Kong, its pivotal role in shaping 
the city’s development, and the influence of the Kadoorie 
family on the modernisation of Hong Kong as well as the 
intangible cultural heritage of Hong Kong. The exhibitions 
promote heritage, culture and environmental education.
CLP Pulse is housed in CLP’s iconic 80-year-old clock 
tower building on Argyle Street, which once served as 
the headquarters for CLP Power. Listed as a Grade 1 
historic building by the Antiquities and Monuments Office
in 2018, it is one of Hong Kong’s few remaining examples of 
international modernist architecture. Entry to the museum 
is free of charge, and complimentary guided tours and 
experiential activities are available.
From its opening in May up to the end of the year, CLP Pulse 
welcomed over 46,000 visitors. The museum also provides 
a permanent headquarters for the Hong Kong Heritage 
Project, which gives access to a rich and storied archive 
that encourages and facilitates scholarship in local history.","CLP Pulse, a unique cultural hub housed in CLP’s renovated clock tower

Enabling Growth and Engagement through Continued 
Community Support
As part of its commitment to community 
stewardship, CLP Power has rolled out a range 
of targeted initiatives to address the needs of 
different communities in Hong Kong.
CLP Power allocated HK$6 million from its Community 
Energy Saving Fund in 2023 to launch the E-Learning 
Assistance Programme. The programme provides new 
electronic learning devices, including iPads, internet 
mobile WiFi hotspots and data SIM cards, to 1,600 
primary, secondary, and tertiary students from low-
income families. The initiative aims to support young 
people needing electronic devices for online classes and e-
learning.

CLP China launched the 3-year 'Rural Vitalisation 
Programme' in 2023. In the first year, CLP China carried 
out 7 projects in 5 regions under the themes of ecological, 
talent and industrial/ agricultural vitalisation. The projects 
have benefitted more than 6,200 people. Also, the 'Knitting 
for the Community"" programme was launched, bringing 
together CLP China volunteer group of employees and 
their families to knit over 600 scarves and accessories for 
the underprivileged in China.
A Volunteer Appreciation Ceremony was held in November 
2023 to recognise the volunteering work of employees 
with NGOs and community partners from 2020 to 2022, 
a period in which employees collectively delivered close 
to 30,000 hours of volunteer service. The Volunteer 
Team adjusted its services in response to the pandemic, 
switching from door-to-door visits to calls to provide 
care for elderly people with early symptoms of dementia;
